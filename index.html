        <ul> 
          <li><b>Client Request:</b> As I was choosing what sorts of projects I wanted to include in my portfolio, I decided to look within my own personal dilemmas. For the past couple months I have been living as a bit of a nomad which meant I was essentially living out of my suitcase. I found myself rummaging through my clothes to decide on an outfit, to then reorganize, to then rummage again the next day. To avoid a mess I would sometimes rewear a lot of the items that were sitting on top, forgetting all about the rest of my precious wardrobe.</li> 
          <li><b>Solution:</b> I decided to use JavaScript React to create a closet search filter. This allowed me to be able to scroll through my items as well as filter the results depending on type or color. I included functions such as "pin" (which requires simply clicking the item) and "unpin" in order to see different clothing items next to each other. There is also a hide button to prevent the item from appearing wheather it's because it's a no or because it's in the dirty bin.</li>
          <li><b>Skills Performed:</b> HTML/CSS, JavaScript React, filtering arrays, Class Based Components, use of constructor/super functions to set state</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Client Request:</b> For my next project, I wanted to create another website that I could use everyday. Something I make sure to do often is journal - whether it's recalling a happy event or reflecting on current emotions, I have found it to be very beneficial for my own being. I do like to journal by hand, but sometimes if I'm in a time crunch or have lots to say I turn to typing. I will usually just use my notes App however wanted to create something that had more of a journal feel, something seperate from where I keep my daily to do lists.</li> 
          <li><b>Solution:</b> I decided to create a simple online blog platform using JavaScript React as well as Google Firebase. For the homepage I decided on a photo of a journal along with some writing I did on SketchPad to create that handwritten journal feel. Under "thoughts" I have the entries being transferred from Firebase appearing in order from newest to oldest. Lastly, you can create a new entry under the "new" tab that will add onto the Firebase data collection at publish. I kept the design clean and simple embodying that of an empty notebook.</li>
          <li><b>Skills Performed:</b> HTML/CSS, JavaScript React, React Hooks: useState and useEffect, Google FireBase </li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Description:</b> I knew when it came time to building my portfolio - I was going to want to design and code it myself. As lovely as a lot of the website templates and builders these days could be, I find they sometimes fall flat when it comes to personality. I wanted to make sure to showcase not only my skills but as well as my style. I went with the Cormorant Gamarond font to keep it sleek and elegant, an antique cream background, a playful collage header to showcase my love for film photograpy.</li>
          <li><b>Skills Performed:</b> HTML/CSS, CSS Grid, Flexbox, JavaScript</li>
